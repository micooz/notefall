 * On-disk schema for `.nfz` (notefall zip) project files.
 *
 * # Versioning policy (pre-1.0)
 *
 * No migration / schema-version system right now — the project is in
 * beta with no real users, so a breaking shape change just requires
 * re-saving any local files. Settings load via a lenient merge
 * (`actions.ts:loadSettings`) so adding/removing keys is free; renames
 * silently drop the old key. Add a migration step back in once we
 * actually ship to users.
 *
 * # Layout inside the .nfz zip
 *
 *   my-project.nfz  (zip)
 *   ├ manifest.json   ← shape described by `ProjectManifest` below
 *   └ assets/
 *      └ song.mid     ← raw SMF bytes (absent when the project has no song)
 *
 * MIDI is stored as a binary asset rather than base64 inside the manifest
 * so the zip stays self-describing on hand-extraction and avoids the 33%
 * inflation of base64 — MIDI is typically the largest payload in a project.
