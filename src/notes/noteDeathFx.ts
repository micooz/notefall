 * subscribers consume each event:
 *   1. HitParticles — fires its standard curl-noise particle burst at
 *      the death position via the listener API.
 *   2. FallingNotes — reads the active fading-ghost list each frame and
 *      renders each dying note as an extra instance with a smoothly-
 *      easing alpha multiplier. Same shader as a normal falling note,
 *      so the ghost matches the deleted note's appearance exactly.
 *
 * Bulk-delete paths (Delete/Backspace, programmatic deleteNotes) skip
 * this channel — wholesale deletion shouldn't spawn dozens of overlapping
 * puffs.
